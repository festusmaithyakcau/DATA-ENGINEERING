    "Pandas is an open source Python library for highly specialized data analysis. Currently it is the reference\n",
    "point that all professionals using the Python language need to study and analyze data sets for statistical\n",
    "purposes of analysis and decision making.\n",
    "This library has been designed and developed primarily by Wes McKinney starting in 2008; later, in\n",
    "2012, Sien Chang, one of his colleagues, was added to the development. Together they set up one of the most\n",
    "used libraries in the Python community.\n",
    "Pandas arises from the need to have a specific library for analysis of the data which provides, in the\n",
    "simplest possible way, all the instruments for the processing of data, data extraction, and data manipulation.\n",
    "This Python package is designed on the basis of the NumPy library. This choice, we can say, was critical\n",
    "to the success and the rapid spread of pandas. In fact, this choice not only makes this library compatible with\n",
    "most of the other modules, but also takes advantage of the high quality of performance in calculating of the\n",
    "NumPy module.\n",
    "Another fundamental choice has been to design ad hoc data structures for the data analysis. In fact,\n",
    "instead of using existing data structures built into Python or provided by other libraries, two new data\n",
    "structures have been developed.\n",
    "These data structures are designed to work with relational data or labeled, thus allowing you to manage\n",
    "data with features similar to those designed for SQL relational databases and Excel spreadsheets.\n",
    "Throughout the book, in fact, we will see a series of basic operations for data analysis, normally used on\n",
    "the database tables or spreadsheets. Pandas in fact provides an extended set of functions and methods that\n",
    "allow you to perform, and in many cases even in the best way, these operations.\n",
    "So pandas has as its main purpose to provide all the building blocks for anyone approaching the world\n",
    "of data analysis."
