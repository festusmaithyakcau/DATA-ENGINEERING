It makes it easy to visualize the expression of thousands of genes obtained from -omics research (e.g., transcriptomics, genomics, proteomics, etc.) and to identify genes with significant changes. It is used to plot the log fold change in the observation between two conditions (e.g., the gene expression between comparison and control conditions) on the x-axis. On the y-axis is the corresponding p-value for each observation, representing the statistical significance of the change (if any) between the different conditions.\n","\n","A volcano plot can visualize a lot of complex information in one plot.

The zero (0) point on the x-axis represents no change. For every point increment to the right of 0, the amount of the change doubles. For example, 1 on the x-axis represents an increase of twice the original (control) value, 2 on the x-axis represents an increase of 4 times the original value, and 3 on the x-axis represents an increase of 8 times the original value. Every point below 0 is interpreted similarly except that it represents a decrease in the original (control) value.\n","    \n","The <b>y-axis</b> of a Volcano plot represents the significance of the change on the x-axis in p-values (probability values). The zero (0) point on the y-axis represents a p-value of 1.0. For every point increase on the y-axis, the decimal point of the p-value moves one place to the left. For example, 2 on the y-axis is equivalent to a p-value of .01, which can be interpreted as there's appoxiamtely a 1% chance that you could get the value that you observed, assuming that there is no difference between the control and experimental conditions. In other words, it suggests that the observation appears to be significant. (A 3 on the y-axis would represent a p-value of .001, a 4 would represent a p-value of .0001, etc.)\n","</div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6aedb316","metadata":{"id":"6aedb316"},"source":["---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"21d37ffc","metadata":{"id":"21d37ffc"},"source":["# Example Volcano Plot of Gene Expression"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"34620380","metadata":{"id":"34620380"},"source":["The volcano plot enables the ability to quickly see the effect (if any) of an experiment (e.g., change in protein expression) between two conditions in terms of both an increase and decrease of the observed value along with the statistical significance of any observed change."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1cda1ee4","metadata":{"id":"1cda1ee4"},"source":["### ‚úÖ `Run` each of the cells below:"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3ee07047","metadata":{"id":"3ee07047"},"source":["### Sample data set\n","The sample data below shows **gene names**, **log<sub>2</sub>-fold changes**, and the **p-values** for the observed changes."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"id":"85ddf3e0","metadata":{"id":"85ddf3e0"},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","from bioinfokit import analys, visuz\n","\n","df = pd.read_csv(\"data/data_volcano_plot/volcano_data.csv\")\n","\n","df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3a78e60b","metadata":{"id":"3a78e60b"},"source":["### Sample Plot\n","The sample plot below indicates that the threshold of significance is a log<sub>2</sub>-fold change beyond ¬±1.
