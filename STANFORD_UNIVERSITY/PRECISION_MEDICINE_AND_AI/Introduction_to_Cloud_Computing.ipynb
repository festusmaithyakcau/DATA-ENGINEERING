For example, if you are running a pharmaceutical startup, your employees can use your company‚Äôs physical computer hardware more efficiently with cloud computing. They can run more data and algorithms with just one computer, and generate more results for your company in a single day. Essentially, they can do more ‚Äújobs‚Äù. Cloud computing is a great return on investment for a business, and provides your company with a competitive edge.\n",

In the context of cloud computing, we decide what we will include in our room (i.e. our virtual machine) depending on the job we will perform: do we need storage? Do we need computers?\n",
