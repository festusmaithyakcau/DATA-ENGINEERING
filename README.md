# DATA ENGINEERING 
# LEARNING DATA ENGINEERING AND ML FROM SCRATCH 

In most organizations, a data engineer is the primary role responsible for integrating, transforming, and consolidating data from various structured and unstructured data systems into structures that are suitable for building analytics solutions. An Azure data engineer also helps ensure that data pipelines and data stores are high-performing, efficient, organized, and reliable, given a specific set of business requirements and constraints.

# Types of data
There are three primary types of data that a data engineer will work with:

**Structured**
Structured data primarily comes from table-based source systems such as a relational database or from a flat file such as a comma separated (CSV) file. The primary element of a structured file is that the rows and columns are aligned consistently throughout the file.

**Semi-Structured**

Semi-structured data is data such as JavaScript object notation (JSON) files, which may require flattening prior to loading into your source system. When flattened, this data doesn't have to fit neatly into a table structure.

**Unstructured**

Unstructured data includes data stored as key-value pairs that don't adhere to standard relational models and Other types of unstructured data that are commonly used include portable data format (PDF), word processor documents, and images.
